Introduction
============

.. include:: ../includes/global.rst

This document describes the computer systems, networks, services and other
elements of the data center environment deployed and managed by the DebOps
Project software.

The software and applications written by the DebOps Project are used in many
different environments and different contexts. Here you will find documentation
which describes common elements of such environments. This document is written
in hopes that it can be used to guide the development of the Project in the
future.

At the moment this document is only a draft and does not fully reflect the
current state of the DebOps Project. You should read the list of references to
get a better idea of what the Project might look like and behave in the future.
