Introduction
============

`Elasticsearch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch>`_ is a distributed

The software is developed by `Elastic <https://elastic.co/>`_.

The ``debops.elasticsearch`` Ansible role can be used to deploy and manage
Elasticsearch instances on one or more (3+) hosts. The role can be used as
a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow control over their configuration
options in the Elasticsearch configuration file.
