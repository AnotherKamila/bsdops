Introduction
============

To use Ansible roles, you need playbooks which define what roles are run on
which hosts. ``debops-playbooks`` repository contains a set of such playbooks
which let you use roles without the need to write them yourself.

Apart from the playbooks, this repository contains a set of Ansible modules,
various plugins and custom fact scripts used through the project. Some of
them are required by the whole project, some just by a few selected roles.
