Stable releases
===============

At the moment there are no stable releases of DebOps. First stable release,
``v1.0.0`` is planned for spring 2018.

DebOps codebase is tagged using the `Semantic Versioning`__ system. The
``v0.y.z`` series is used to stabilize and clean up the existing code.

.. __: https://semver.org/

After the first stable release, the plan is to use the ``stable-x.y``
:command:`git` branches to track the latest release from a given version. Most
likely at most two major versions will be supported at any given time,
depending on available resources. Stable releases will receive only bugfixes
and security fixes cherry-picked from the development tree, no new features or
significant changes will be made.
